        "\n",
        "   * Prompt: “Generate a 7-day meal plan that meets these daily macros: calories 2200, protein 160g, carbs 240g, fat 70g. Provide 3 main meals + 2 snacks per day, shopping list, and simple recipes with estimated prep times.”\n",

        "\n",
        "12. **Nutrition Education + Tips**\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Store plans as JSON** — easy to read, modify, and send to a front end. Design a simple schema: user_profile, weekly_workouts, daily_meals, grocery_list.\n",
        "2. **Use `pandas` for tabular operations** — helpful when producing CSV export (shopping lists, schedules).\n",
        "3. **Keep business logic separate** — separate modules: `nutrition.py` (calcs), `workout.py` (exercise selection & progression), `io.py` (save/load).\n",
        "4. **Make exercise + recipe libraries** — a small DB (JSON) with tags: equipment, muscles, difficulty, time, calories-per-serving.\n",
        "5. **Use simple rule-based algorithms first** — e.g., choose 3 compound lifts per workout, pick accessory from matching muscle tags, scale sets by experience.\n",
        "6. **Add user feedback loop** — allow users to rate sessions; use that to re-weight exercise probability.\n",
        "7. **For deployments** — Flask or FastAPI for API; store user data in SQLite initially, then upgrade to Postgres when needed.\n",
        "8. **Packaging** — add CLI commands to generate/export plans (use `argparse`) for quick testing.\n",
